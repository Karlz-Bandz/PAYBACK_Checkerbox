# PAYBACK_Checkerboard


The checkerbox application is the PAYBACK recruitment task.

Have to create 2D Array with size 15x15 and each square has the only one point.
After each round the all points randomly jump to the adjacent square.

After 25 rounds player can get one square that have the greatest number of
points or continue to play and wait for the next collecting of points 
which is at round 50. The last time when player can collect any points
is at round 100.

     !IMPORTANT!

*   The application logic always works correct, but it is displayed correct only
*  when is run on Windows command line or IOS/Linux terminal. It happens because
*  private method clearConsole inside the GameBoot class doesn't work on any IDE
*  console.
*  
*  To run in a console go to the command prompt and navigate to the
*  directory where your PAYBACK_Checkerboard file is saved using the "cd" command.
*  Compile your Java code by entering the command "javac Main.java" in src/main/java
*  folder. When code has been already compiled, to run application enter the command "java Main"
* 
*  More information will be displayed when you run the program. More details and descriptions can
*  be found inside interfaces and classes documentation.
*
*  Of course if you want inside the out/artifact folder you can find .jar file with the
*  built application it is the easiest way to run it with java -jar example.jar
